      "  What is cirrhosis?\n",
      "  Cirrhosis is a very serious condition in which scarring damages the liver. This scar tissue prevents the liver from working as it should. That can cause problems with blood clotting, which can lead to bleeding and bruising. Cirrhosis can also cause fluid buildup in the belly, jaundice, and severe bleeding in the digestive tract.\n",
      "  What causes it?\n",
      "  Cirrhosis can have many causes. Long-term, heavy use of alcohol can cause cirrhosis. So can chronic viral hepatitis. Other causes include autoimmune diseases, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), blocked bile ducts in the liver, and certain diseases.\n",
      "  What are the symptoms?\n",
      "  You may not have symptoms in the early stages of cirrhosis. But as it gets worse, symptoms may include fatigue, yellowing of the skin (jaundice), small red spots and tiny lines on the skin, bruising easily, weight loss, itching, belly pain, and bleeding in the digestive tract.\n",
      "  How is cirrhosis treated?\n",
      "  Treatment may include medicines such as Diuretics, surgery, or lifestyle changes. Treatment can't cure cirrhosis. But it can sometimes prevent or delay more liver damage. To limit the damage to your liver and help control symptoms, you can make lifestyle changes. For example, don't drink alcohol. Limit sodium and fat. And avoid medicines that can harm your liver.\n",
